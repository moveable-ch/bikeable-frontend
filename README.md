🚴 🚴 🚴 🚴

**Let's make our cities bikeable!**

Bikeable.ch is a community-driven collection of good and bad spots for bicycle riders, and a place to discuss and find solutions.

This repository is the web frontend, written in JavaScript using the [Vue.js framework](https://vuejs.org/).

Feel free to report issues or contribute and make pull requests.

## Backend
We have not yet made our backend code public. Please contact us if you'd like to get access to the repository and/or the API documentation. We are also open to other uses of our API, let us know what you plan to do with our data.

If you want to work on the frontend without running your own backend, you can use the production backend by setting `VUE_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://backend.bikeable.ch` in a `.env` file.
