    <h3 id="begriffe">2.1 Terms</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Personal data</strong> is <em>any</em> information relating to an
      identified or identifiable natural person. A
      <strong>data subject</strong> is a person about whom we process personal
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Processing</strong> includes <em>any</em> handling of personal
      data, <em>irrespective</em> of the means and procedures used, such as
      querying, matching, adapting, archiving, storing, reading out, disclosing,
      procuring, recording, collecting, deleting, disclosing, arranging,
      organising, storing, modifying, disseminating, linking, destroying and

    <h2 id="art-umfang-zweck">3. nature, scope and purpose</h2>

    <p>
      We process the personal data that is <em>required in</em> order to be able
      to carry out our activities and operations in a permanent, user-friendly,
      secure and reliable manner. Such personal data may in particular fall into
      the categories of inventory and contact data, browser and device data,
      content data, meta or marginal data and usage data, location data, sales
      data and contract and payment data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We process personal data for the <em>duration</em> that is required for
      the respective purpose(s) or by law. Personal data whose processing is no
      longer required is anonymised or deleted.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may have personal data processed <em>by third parties</em>. We may
      process personal data jointly with third parties or transmit it to third
      parties. Such third parties are, in particular, specialised providers
      whose services we use. We also guarantee data protection for such third
      parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>As a matter of principle,</em> we only process personal data with the
      consent of the persons concerned. If and insofar as the processing is
      permitted for other legal reasons, we may waive the requirement to obtain
      consent. For example, we may process personal data without consent in
      order to fulfil a contract, to comply with legal obligations or to protect
      overriding interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this context, we process in particular information that a data subject
      <em>voluntarily</em> provides to us when contacting us - for example, by
      letter, email, instant messaging, contact form, social media or telephone
      - or when registering for a user account. We may store such information,
      for example, in an address book, in a customer relationship management
      system (CRM system) or with comparable tools. If we receive data about
      other persons, the transmitting persons are obliged to ensure data
      protection vis-à-vis these persons and to ensure the accuracy of this
      personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also process personal data that we receive from third parties, obtain
      from publicly available sources or collect in the course of our activities
      and operations, if and to the extent that such processing is permitted for
      legal reasons.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ausland">4. personal data abroad</h2>

    <p>
      We <em>process</em> personal data in Switzerland and in the European
      Economic Area (EEA). However, we may also export or transfer personal data
      to other countries, in particular in order to process it or have it
      processed there.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may export personal data to all

        target="_blank"
        >decision of the European Commission</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may transfer personal data to countries whose law does not guarantee
      adequate data protection, provided that data protection is guaranteed for
      other reasons, in particular on the basis of standard data protection
      clauses or with other appropriate guarantees. By way of exception, we may
      export personal data to countries without adequate or appropriate data
      protection if the special data protection law requirements are met, for
      example the express consent of the data subjects or a direct connection
      with the conclusion or performance of a contract. We will be happy to
      provide data subjects with information about any guarantees or a copy of
      any guarantees on request.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rechte">5. rights of data subjects</h2>

    <h3 id="ansprueche">5.1 Data protection claims</h3>

    <p>
      We grant data subjects all rights under applicable data protection law. In
      particular, data subjects have the following rights:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Information:</strong> Data subjects can request information as
        to whether we process personal data about them and, if so, what personal
        data is involved. Data subjects also receive the information necessary
        to assert their data protection rights and to ensure transparency. This
        includes the personal data processed as such, but also, among other
        things, information on the purpose of processing, the duration of
        storage, any disclosure or export of data to other countries and the
        origin of the personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Correction and restriction:</strong> Data subjects can have
        incorrect personal data corrected, incomplete data completed and the
        processing of their data restricted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deletion and objection:</strong> Data subjects can have personal
        data deleted ("right to be forgotten") and<strong>object</strong> to the
        processing of their data with effect for the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data release and data transfer:</strong> Data subjects may
        request the surrender of personal data or the transfer of their data to
        another data controller.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We may suspend, restrict or refuse the exercise of the rights of data
      subjects to the extent permitted by law. We can draw the attention of data
      subjects to any requirements that must be met in order to exercise their
      rights under data protection law. For example, we may refuse to provide
      information in whole or in part with reference to business secrets or the
      protection of other persons. We may also, for example, refuse to delete
      personal data in whole or in part with reference to statutory retention
      obligations.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may <em>exceptionally</em> provide for costs for the exercise of
      rights. We inform affected persons in advance of any costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are obliged to take reasonable steps to identify data subjects who
      request information or assert other rights. Data subjects are obliged to
      cooperate.
    </p>

    <h3 id="beschwerderecht">5.2 Right to complain</h3>

    <p>
      Data subjects have the right to enforce their data protection claims
      through legal channels or to lodge a complaint with a competent data
      protection supervisory authority.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data protection supervisory authority for private data controllers and
      federal bodies in Switzerland is the Federal

        >Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a
      >
      (FDPIC).
    </p>

    <p>
      Data subjects have - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR) is applicable - the right to lodge a complaint with a
      competent

        rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        >European data protection supervisory authority</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sicherheit">6. data security</h2>

    <p>
      We take suitable technical and organisational measures to ensure data
      security appropriate to the respective risk. However, we cannot guarantee
      absolute data security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Access to our website is via transport encryption (SSL / TLS, in
      particular with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, abbreviated
      HTTPS). Most browsers indicate transport encryption with a padlock in the
      address bar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our digital communication is subject - like all digital communication in
      <em>principle</em> - to mass surveillance without cause or suspicion and
      other monitoring by security authorities in Switzerland, the rest of
      Europe, the United States of America (USA) and other countries. We cannot
      directly influence the corresponding processing of personal data by secret
      services, police agencies and other security authorities.

      Cookies can be stored in the browser temporarily as "session cookies" or
      for a certain period of time as so-called permanent cookies. "Session
      cookies" are automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Permanent
      cookies have a specific storage period. Cookies make it possible in
      particular to recognise a browser the next time it visits our website and

    <p>
      We may collect the following information for each access to our website,
      provided that this information is transmitted by your browser to our
      server infrastructure or can be determined by our web server: Date and
      time including time zone, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access status
      (HTTP status code), operating system including user interface and version,
      browser including language and version, individual sub-page of our website
      accessed including amount of data transferred, website last accessed in
      the same browser window (referer or referrer).
    </p>

    <p>
      We store such information, which may also constitute personal data, in
      server log files. The information is required to provide our website in a
      permanent, user-friendly and reliable manner and to ensure data security
      and thus in particular the protection of personal data - also by third
      parties or with the help of third parties.
    </p>

    <h3 id="zaehlpixel">7.3 Tracking pixel</h3>

    <p>
      We may use tracking pixels on our website. Tracking pixels are also known
      as web beacons. Tracking pixels - also from third parties whose services
      we use - are small, usually invisible images that are automatically
      retrieved when you visit our website. Pixel counters can be used to
      collect the same information as server log files.

    <h2 id="mitteilungen">8. notifications and messages</h2>

    <p>
      We send notifications and communications by email and through other
      communication channels such as instant messaging or SMS.
    </p>

    <h3 id="mitteilungen-statistik">8.1 Success and reach measurement</h3>

    <p>
      Notifications and messages may contain web links or tracking pixels that
      record whether an individual message has been opened and which web links
      have been clicked on. Such web links and tracking pixels may also track
      usage of notifications and communications on a personal basis. We need
      this statistical recording of usage for performance and reach measurement
      in order to be able to send notifications and messages effectively and in
      a user-friendly manner based on the needs and reading habits of the
      recipients, as well as permanently, securely and reliably.
    </p>

    <h3 id="mitteilungen-einwilligung">8.2 Consent and objection</h3>

    <p>
      <em>As a matter of principle,</em> you must expressly consent to the use
      of your e-mail address and other contact addresses, unless such use is
      permitted for other legal reasons. For any consent, we use the "double
      opt-in" procedure where possible, i.e. you receive an e-mail with a web
      link that you must click to confirm so that no misuse by unauthorised
      third parties can take place. We may log such consents including Internet
      Protocol (IP) address, date and time for evidence and security reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <em>principle,</em> you can object to receiving notifications and
      communications such as newsletters at any time. With such an objection,
      you can simultaneously object to the statistical recording of use for
      performance and reach measurement. Necessary notifications and
      communications in connection with our activities and operations remain
      reserved.

    <p>
      The General Terms and Conditions (GTC) and Terms of Use as well as data
      protection declarations and other provisions of the individual operators
      of such platforms also apply in each case. These provisions inform in
      particular about the rights of data subjects directly vis-à-vis the
      respective platform, which includes, for example, the right to
      information.

    <h2 id="dienste">10. third party services</h2>

    <p>
      We use services provided by specialised third parties in order to carry
      out our activities and operations in a durable, user-friendly, secure and
      reliable manner. With such services, we can, among other things, embed
      functions and content in our website. In the case of such embedding, the
      services used record the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the users at
      least temporarily for technically compelling reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      For necessary security-related, statistical and technical purposes, third
      parties whose services we use may process data in connection with our
      activities and operations in aggregated, anonymised or pseudonymised form.
      This is, for example, performance or usage data in order to be able to
      offer the respective service.

      11. success and reach measurement

    <p>
      We try to determine how our online offer is used. In this context, we can,
      for example, measure the success and reach of our activities and
      operations as well as the effect of third-party links to our website. But
      we can also, for example, try out and compare how different parts or
      versions of our online offer are used ("A/B test" method). Based on the
      results of the success and reach measurement, we can in particular correct
      errors, strengthen popular content or make improvements to our online
      offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In most cases, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of individual users
      are stored for performance and reach measurement. In this case, IP
      addresses are <em>always</em> shortened ("IP masking") in order to follow
      the principle of data economy through the corresponding pseudonymisation.

    <p>
      Cookies may be used for performance and reach measurement and user
      profiles may be created. Any user profiles created include, for example,
      the individual pages visited or content viewed on our website, information
      on the size of the screen or browser window and the - at least approximate
      - location. <em>In principle,</em> any user profiles are created
      exclusively in pseudonymised form and are not used to identify individual
      users. Individual services of third parties with which users are
      registered may be able to assign the use of our online services to the
      user account or user profile of the respective service.
